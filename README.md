# ummless.tech

A web application built during the hackathon DeltaHacks 8 in January 2022.

Using the AssemblyAI API, our application allows users to upload audio files, and those audio files are analyzed for sentiment, filler words, and speaking speed. This analysis is then presented to the user in a user-friendly, easy-to-read format, so users can see where they can improve in their speeches.

Built using React, Flask and Python.
